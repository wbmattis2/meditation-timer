# Text-to-Spirit

A meditation timer made with React, Bible API, and Web Speech API. Designed and developed by Benny Mattis.  

## How to Use

Choose a Psalm to listen to it through the eloquent Web Speech API. 

Hold the plus and minus buttons to increase or decrease the duration of your meditation session. Verses will be distributed evenly across the duration of your meditation. 

Each Psalm has a minimum duration to ensure that you have adequate time to reflect on its contents. Please note that you will not be able to make your session duration shorter than the total minumum duration for the remaining verses in your selected chapter.

## Technology/Special Thanks

Psalms are fetched from [Tim Morgan's Bible API](bible-api.com). This app was created with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).
