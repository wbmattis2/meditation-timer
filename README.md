# Text-2-Spirit
A meditation timer made with React, Bible API, and Web Speech API
by Benny Mattis

Choose a Psalm to listen to it through the eloquent Web Speech API. 

Hold the plus and minus buttons to increase or decrease the duration of your meditation session. Verses will be distributed evenly across the duration of your meditation. 

Each Psalm has a minimum duration to ensure that you have adequate time to reflect on its contents.

Psalms are fetched from Tim Morgan's Bible API (bible-api.com).
